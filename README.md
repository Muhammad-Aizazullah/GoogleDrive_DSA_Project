# Google Drive File System (C++ Project)

This is a console-based file system simulation developed using C++ for the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) course at FAST National University. It mimics the core functionality of Google Drive using various data structures.


## 📚 Project Overview

The **Google Drive File System** simulates:

- Folder creation and navigation
- File creation, update, deletion, and rollback
- File sharing with permission control
- Recently used and deleted files tracking
- User authentication and version control

It applies object-oriented programming along with multiple advanced **Data Structures**.


## 🧠 Data Structures Used

| Data Structure | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|
| **Tree** | Folder & directory structure |
| **Doubly Linked List** | File versioning (rollback system) |
| **Stack** | Recycle Bin (recently deleted files) |
| **Queue** | Recently accessed files (LRU system) |
| **Hash Table** | File metadata storage (fast lookup) |
| **Graph** | User sharing system (permissions & file sharing) |
| **Heap (Max)** | File priority management |


## ⚙️ Features

- 🗂️ Create, delete, and navigate folders
- 📄 Create, update, delete, and rollback files
- 🔐 User signup, login, password recovery
- 🔄 File versioning and rollback
- 🗑️ Recycle bin system
- 🕘 Track recently used files
- 📊 File metadata search (size, owner, type, date)
- 🔗 Share files between users (Admin, Editor, Viewer roles)
- 🚦 Priority management with heap display


## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open in any C++ IDE (e.g. CodeBlocks, Visual Studio, Dev C++).
2. Build and run `main.cpp` or the main `.cpp` file.
3. Use the menu-driven interface in the terminal.

No external libraries needed (uses standard C++ headers only).
